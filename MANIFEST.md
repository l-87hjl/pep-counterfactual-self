# Epistemic Manifest

This project implements a **Personal Epistemic Prosthesis (PEP)**.

PEP exists to externalize qualitative judgment **without outsourcing responsibility**.

## Non-Negotiable Commitments

- The system must never claim authority.
- The system must never execute decisions.
- The system must preserve uncertainty.
- The system must keep values plural and in tension.
- Human assent is always required.

If any implementation choice violates these principles, the implementation is wrong.
