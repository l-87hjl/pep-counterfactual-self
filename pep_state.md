# PEP State (Working Epistemic Memory)

## Purpose
This file exists to prevent epistemic reset between sessions.
It summarizes what the system *currently believes about itself*, not about the world.

---

## Active Value Shards

- Autonomy
- Integrity
- Long-term Growth
- Care for Others
- Stability / Security

(Shards are descriptive, not prescriptive.)

---

## Known Tensions

- Autonomy ↔ Security
- Growth ↔ Stability
- Care ↔ Personal Limits

---

## Hard Constraints

- No automatic decisions
- No global scoring
- No value collapse
- No hidden inference of values

---

## Open Epistemic Questions

- How to represent novelty without overweighting precedent?
- How to surface moral injury distinctly from regret?

---

## Last Structural Change

- Initial schema and architecture committed
