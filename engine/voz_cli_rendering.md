# VOZ Rendering in CLI Synthesis

This document specifies how **Value Override Zone (VOZ)** signals appear in CLI synthesis output.

The goal is to surface contextual instability **without sounding ominous, urgent, or directive**.

---

## Placement

VOZ signals appear:
- After precedent summary
- Before plausible judgment descriptions
- In a clearly labeled but understated section

Label:

"Contextual Notes"

---

## Formatting

- Plain text
- No symbols, emojis, or alerts
- No bullet points that imply priority
- Neutral sentence casing

Example:

Contextual Notes:
- Several core considerations are strongly present at the same time.
- Similar tradeoffs have not resolved cleanly in the past.

---

## Tone Constraints

VOZ output must:
- Avoid urgency
- Avoid prediction
- Avoid suggestion
- Avoid reassurance

Allowed framing:
- Observational
- Past-oriented
- Conditional

Disallowed framing:
- "Be careful"
- "Warning"
- "This is important"
- "You should"

---

## Mandatory Closing Line

Every VOZ section must end with:

> "This note is descriptive only and does not imply any particular outcome."

This sentence may not be altered.

---

## Absence Handling

If no VOZ signals are present:
- The section is omitted entirely
- No statement of absence is printed

Silence is preferred to false reassurance.
