# Value Override Zone (VOZ) Signals

This document defines the **exact non-numeric signals** PEP may surface when a situation qualifies as a Value Override Zone.

These signals are descriptive, optional, and non-authoritative.
They are intended to prompt *attention*, not action.

---

## Signal Set (Exact)

PEP may surface zero or more of the following signals.
Each signal must be phrased neutrally and independently.

---

### 1. Concurrent Core Pressures

**Text:**
> "Several core considerations are strongly present at the same time."

**Meaning:**
Multiple value shards with high historical salience are co-activated.

---

### 2. Historically Unsettled Tradeoff

**Text:**
> "Similar tradeoffs have not resolved cleanly in the past."

**Meaning:**
Precedent exists, but includes caveats, overrides, or later regret.

---

### 3. Exception-Heavy Precedent

**Text:**
> "Past decisions here often required exceptions or special reasoning."

**Meaning:**
Precedent relied on situational justification rather than stable rules.

---

### 4. Identity-Adjacent Framing

**Text:**
> "This situation appears closely connected to how you see yourself."

**Meaning:**
Language indicates identity, integrity, or self-concept involvement.

---

### 5. Sensitivity to Small Changes

**Text:**
> "Small changes in conditions could significantly change how acceptable options feel."

**Meaning:**
Counterfactuals show sharp discontinuities in acceptability.

---

### 6. Atypical Decision Process

**Text:**
> "Your decision process here differs from your usual pace or clarity."

**Meaning:**
Hesitation, reframing, or meta-uncertainty is present.

## Prohibited Variations

PEP must not:
- Combine signals into a score
- Use intensifiers ("high risk", "danger")
- Imply inevitability
- Suggest action or delay

Signals are informational only.
